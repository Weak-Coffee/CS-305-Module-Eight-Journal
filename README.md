# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial consulting firm that provides customized financial plans. They are looking to develop a secure web application to support their consumers. The platform needs to be secure as they deal with sensative financial information and PII. 

# What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I think I was able to identify the best tools for the client to use to secure their product. Security is imporant because any kind of vulnerability that can lead to a breach in consumer inforation can result in financial lost and loss in consumer confidence. 

# What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The hardest part of the vulnerability assessment for me was determining which vulnerabilities were false flags. Understanding your code and what it does is very imporant when determining whether to ignore a vulnerability or not. 

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by implementing the SHA-256 hashing algorith into the platform. I think in the future I would perform more customized tests to assess vulnerabilites. 

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
To make sure the code and software were functional and secure I tested before and after refactoring my code. This involved testing the functionality and running the vulnerabilites report both before and after to compare the two. 

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The Maven dependancy checker was a very helpful too that I would use in the future. 

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show them my understanding of tools that can be used to check software for vulnerabilites.
